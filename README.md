## Development Process

The development process involved the following steps:

1. **Planning**: Identified the requirements and sketched out the user interface.
2. **API Integration**: Chose the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data retrieval and integrated it into the application.
3. **User Interface**: Created a user-friendly interface using HTML and styled it with CSS.
4. **JavaScript Logic**: Wrote JavaScript code to handle user input, make API requests, and display weather information.
5. **Testing and Debugging**: Tested the application thoroughly to ensure proper functionality and handled errors appropriately.
6. **Responsive Design**: Made the application responsive to ensure compatibility with various devices.

## Challenges Faced

- **API Integration**: Understanding how to properly integrate with the OpenWeatherMap API and handle API responses posed a challenge initially. Reading and understanding the API documentation was crucial.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling for scenarios such as invalid city names and network errors required careful consideration and testing.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the application's layout and design looked good and functioned well across different screen sizes and devices presented its own set of challenges.

Overall, overcoming these challenges involved thorough research, experimentation, and iterative development to create a functional and user-friendly weather application.
